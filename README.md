# MyApartment
2019 SPRING - BIL 496 group project

an apartment management application

Issues:


1-) As a user, I want to be able to receive notifications via the mobile app about important announcements in my apartment.

2-) As a user, I want to be able to not join apartment meetings because I think the meetings are waste of time and I don't want to waste time in my holidays.So, I think we can discuss important decisions through a mobile application with neighbors.

3-) As a user, I would like to be able to vote through a mobile application rather than vote at important meetings for meetings. Because everyone can not attend apartment meetings, but they can easily vote without a practice.

4-) As a user, I want to be able to send a private message to a neighbor I do not recognize.For example, I think that we can solve problems arising from not parking properly in the car park by simply sending a message.I think that the private message system will be beneficial for everyone to solve the problems like this.

5-) As a user, I want to be able to offer suggestions about my apartment through a mobile application and exchange ideas with my neighbors about the developments about the apartment.
